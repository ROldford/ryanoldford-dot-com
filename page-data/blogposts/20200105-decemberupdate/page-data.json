For the\nmost part, they were reasonably straightforward, with 2 exceptions. On the CPSC\n110 exam, there was a question involving a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie\">trie</a>. That thing took me so long to figure\nout! The CPSC 121 exam had a proof question involving an inequality, which I'm\nnot that great at. I was able to get it all the way to the last step, but I just\ncouldn't figure out how to do the last step.</p>\n<p>In the end, my marks came back better than I'd expected! CPSC 110 was an A +,\n121 was an A, and both of my Psych courses were A+.</p>\n<p>Once exams were done, I headed home to Newfoundland for Christmas. I was able to\nsee how my little nephew and niece are growing up, which was great, and so was\nseeing the rest of the family. I also took part in the <a href=\"redditgifts.com\">Reddit Secret\nSanta</a>, and that's where the card in the photo is from. It's a\nhandmade watercolor card! How great is that?</p>\n<p>Next month should be interesting, with Term 2 starting. I'm doing CPSC 210, so\nwe're getting into more serious software design. I'm also doing COGS 200, which\nI've been told is a messy course, and a pair of 300's level Psych courses. I'm\nlooking forward to how it all goes. Wish me luck!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"December Update","date":"January 05, 2020","tags":["update"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='500'%20height='250'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20250'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M0%20125v125h19c20%200%2020%200%2020-2l1-24%202-44c1-20%201-86-2-161V0H0v125M469%202v3h-2l1%2050v76c-2%2043-2%2078%202%20104l2%2015h28V136c0-121%200-120-4-120-3-1-5-5-5-10-1-5-1-5-2-3v4c1%203%200%205-1%202l-2-1-4-4c-4-4-9-6-9-2l2%201h2v7l-1-1c1-1-1-3-3-2l-1-3c0-4-2-5-3-2'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.9841269841269842,"src":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/db355/christmas-card.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/b1b6d/christmas-card.jpg 125w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/60532/christmas-card.jpg 250w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/db355/christmas-card.jpg 500w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/15914/christmas-card.jpg 750w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/19b10/christmas-card.jpg 1000w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/08e0b/christmas-card.jpg 4032w","srcWebp":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/bf664/christmas-card.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/26c00/christmas-card.webp 125w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/5008a/christmas-card.webp 250w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/bf664/christmas-card.webp 500w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/580a9/christmas-card.webp 750w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/b71aa/christmas-card.webp 1000w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/d246d/christmas-card.webp 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px","originalImg":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/08e0b/christmas-card.jpg","originalName":"christmas-card.jpg","presentationWidth":500,"presentationHeight":250}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blogposts/20200105-decemberupdate/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blogposts/20200105-decemberupdate/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["994739718"]}
