{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I first saw Daniel Solis's Minoquar game back in 2012 while looking into board game design. It turns QR codes into pen-and-paper mazes, where you need to avoid a minotaur and open a treasure to win. It's very interesting, but I always thought it would work better on a computer or mobile phone, and now I have the perfect opportunity to do that with my current software development course.</p>\n<p>Phase 1 of the project was focused on list storage. I had to generate mazes, add them to a list, and read mazes from the list to start games. I also had to develop a text-based UI for the game, though we were given an example project to help understand how this should work. I also decided to implement the player's hero character movement and a game win condition (get to the treasure in the bottom-right alignment pattern), in order to make the game minimally playable. The maze implementation took a long time, because I needed to generate maze layouts with all the features of a real QR code, which the game rules use extensively.</p>\n<p>Phase 2 focused on persistence. Using the provided example project, I implemented a save file format and save system for mazes. I investigated using JSON, which might have been more efficient for storing the complex maze objects, but given the learning time required, I decided on my own format. This turned out to be very useful for testing. I stored each maze layout as a grid of characters, so I could easily generate any needed test layouts by hand. I also implemented the minotaur, complete with rule-based movement and a game fail condition (minotaur moves onto the hero character).</p>\n<p>(Header image by <a href=\"http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/\">Daniel Solis</a>)</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Phase 2 is complete! Phase 3 involves GUI development, so I'll have to start on that very soon.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Minoquar game app","subtitle":"Maze game using QR codes","tags":["java","desktop","game"],"category":"Academic","project":"","demo":"","date":"30 January, 2020","featuredImage":null},"fields":{"slug":"/projects/20200130-minoquar/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/20200130-minoquar/"}}
