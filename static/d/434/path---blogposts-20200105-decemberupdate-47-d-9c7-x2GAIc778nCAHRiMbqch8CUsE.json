{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Year's over, and 1 term down!</p>\n<p>The biggest part of this month, at least in terms of school, was finals. For\nthe most part, they were reasonably straightforward, with 2 exceptions. On\nthe CPSC 110 exam, there was a question involving a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie\">trie</a>. That thing took me so long to\nfigure out! The CPSC 121 exam had a proof question involving an inequality,\nwhich I'm not that great at. I was able to get it all the way to the last step,\nbut I just couldn't figure out how to do the last step.</p>\n<p>In the end, my marks came back better than I'd expected! CPSC 110 was an A\n+, 121 was an A, and both of my Psych courses were A+.</p>\n<p>Once exams were done, I headed home to Newfoundland for Christmas. I was able\nto see how my little nephew and niece are growing up, which was great, and so\nwas seeing the rest of the family. I also took part in the\n<a href=\"redditgifts.com\">Reddit Secret Santa</a>, and that's where the card in the photo\nis from. It's a handmade watercolor card! How great is that?</p>\n<p>Next month should be interesting, with Term 2 starting. I'm doing CPSC 210,\nso we're getting into more serious software design. I'm also doing COGS 200,\nwhich I've been told is a messy course, and a pair of 300's level Psych courses.\nI'm looking forward to how it all goes. Wish me luck!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"December Update","date":"January 05, 2020","tags":["update"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='400' height='300' viewBox='0 0 400 300' version='1'%3e%3cpath d='M0 150v150h401V150l-1-117v34l-4-4-4-3-2-2 1-1h2l-2-1c-3 1-7-2-7-4l-2-2-3-2c-2-3-3-3-3 0l3 3 3 2v10l-1-4c0-2-1-3-2-3l-2-1c-2-2-2-7-3 59-1 112-1 106 2 126l2 18-23 1-35 1c-38 3-59 3-138 3a5064 5064 0 0 1-119-2H31l1-20 1-33a1259 1259 0 0 0-2-161V23l4-1h116a918 918 0 0 0 119 0h7c1 1 1 1 3-2l1-3h-5c-3 0-3 0-2-1 2 0 3-1 3-3l1-3v3c0 4 2 4 2-1 1-5 0-12-1-12l-1 4c0 3-2 4-2 1 0-1 0-2-1-1 0 2-2 0-2-2l-2-2v10l-2 3V8l-1-4V2c1-2 1-2-133-2H0v150m0 1' fill='lightgray' fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.9841269841269842,"src":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/ec9d6/christmas-card.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/9f029/christmas-card.jpg 125w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/d163d/christmas-card.jpg 250w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/ec9d6/christmas-card.jpg 500w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/178ca/christmas-card.jpg 750w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/ffbeb/christmas-card.jpg 1000w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/88750/christmas-card.jpg 1500w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/5cb30/christmas-card.jpg 4032w","srcWebp":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/9837c/christmas-card.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/63d73/christmas-card.webp 125w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/724b6/christmas-card.webp 250w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/9837c/christmas-card.webp 500w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/428c9/christmas-card.webp 750w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/208cb/christmas-card.webp 1000w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/0f7e1/christmas-card.webp 1500w,\n/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/25706/christmas-card.webp 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px","originalImg":"/static/d5cbd795b5f3c827863b53f1d8b968eb/5cb30/christmas-card.jpg","originalName":"christmas-card.jpg","presentationWidth":500,"presentationHeight":375}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blogposts/20200105-decemberupdate/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blogposts/20200105-decemberupdate/"}}
