Not too much to report in February. I spent most of the month continuing the shift to the new robot architecture. I did have some difficulties with the UI side of things that led to me redesigning the threading system to use PyQt's QThread objects, which worked much better. I think I've got a better handle on concurrency as a result!

We were able to run more tests and try some hardware revisions on our tester. It's better, but not 100% reliable yet, but we're definitely getting close.

On the personal side, my friend Mark and I moved from Minecraft to other survival crafting games. We first moved to [Raft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/648800/Raft/), which was a lot of fun. It's funny how the busy loop of checking all the things on the raft that let you survive ends up being less stressful and more meditative. I suppose it's due to the clear nature of the goals. We've basically hit the end of the story in that one, so we've moved to [Valheim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/), which has gotten a big bump in popularity. It's a really beautiful game, and I really like the building options. I'm looking forward to building something really nice!
