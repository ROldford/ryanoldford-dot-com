I wanted to get this out on time, I really did, but basically everything
happened at the beginning of February. I've only just gotten out from
midterms and CS 210 project work, so now I can do some writing.

The first half of January started off fairly easy. CS 210 started with Java
concepts I'd kind of seen before, and a lot of my Psych classes were
rehashes of things I'd seen in Psych 101.
  
As the month went on, CS 210 ramped up. The concepts started to go beyond 110, 
and all my work started to become more difficult, but more interesting. Towards
the end of the month, I was able to start really considering my project, which
is going to implement the game Minoquar by Daniel Solis. (I'll explain more in
my next update.)

My Psych classes similarly became more interesting, but a lot more work.
Psycholinguistics had a project on speech transcription, which we've been using
in group discussions in class. Cognitive Psychology hasn't added a lot of work,
because it's pretty focused on big assignments, but the concepts around
perception have gotten pretty in-depth.

Cognitive Systems has been... interesting. I'm seeing a lot of what other people
have seen in the course. It is very messy, and part of that is the multiple
instructors. But another big part of that is the current focus on philosophy.
I suspect teaching philosophy is difficult to make clear, because it's all
about questions on top of questions, but I really don't feel like my 
instructor is doing much towards that. On the other hand, a lot of the 
questions, like "What counts as intelligence" are genuinely very interesting.

In any case, I'm working my way through it all, and I'm keeping up pretty well.
I'll have a lot more to say about February, though. See you then!
