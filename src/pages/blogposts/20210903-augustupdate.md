Not too much to report this month. I continued working on the final project report and a project update presentation, which went really well. It felt great to close out my work with my colleagues' support.

I've also been spending more time with a friend who's leaving the country, but I've also continued with Jackbox and Beach Game Day with [Meeple Leaf](https://www.meetup.com/Meeple-Leaf/). I actually haven't been back to [Rain City Games](https://www.raincity.games/), since both their game days and the Beach Game Days are on Saturday, but I'll likely go back some weekend in September.

I've also continued working on my [Decryptoquote](/projects/20190716-decryptoquote/) project, and it works nicely! Now I'm continuing by integrating [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as my language model. I just need to figure out how to mock it in testing, then I can work on making the whole thing into a webapp.

The Delta variant does have me a bit down, but I keep reminding myself that I'm double vaccinated, so I should be safe. While the anti-vax folks won't like it, the vaccination passport should help a lot. (Honestly, there's way less of them than we think. They're just loud.) I'm also happy with UBC's new approach, where you have to get clean COVID tests to keep going to class in-person, but you can skip that if you're vaccinated. I might personally lean more on the safety side, but it's a reasonable middle ground. 

As we're starting classes in September, I'll have more to talk about then. See you later!
