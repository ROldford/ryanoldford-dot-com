Welcome to 2022. Everyone buckle up.

I didn't do too much before leaving Vancouver to keep myself safe before the flight home, but I did go to the [Festival Of Lights](https://vandusengarden.org/events/festival-of-lights-2021/) event at the [VanDusen Gardens](https://vandusengarden.org/). The sheer amount of lights and decoration they put across the garden was really impressive! Very beautiful, and really helped get me in the spirit.

I was able to make it home after all, but couldn't get in before Newfoundland's 5-day isolation period started, so I had to spend actual Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in a hotel. Fortunately, the isolation went well, and we did a delayed Christmas celebration that pushed our usual Christmas and New Year's stuff into 4 straight days! The important part is that I got to spend time with everyone I've missed, especially my niece and nephew. (I made them some knitted cloths that I messed up the gauge on, so they ended up rectangular when I wanted them to be square, but they still liked them.)

Over the isolation, I was able to do some work on my [Decryptoquote solver project](/projects/20190716-decryptoquote/). It went from being able to give one solution on the command line, to being a [full-fledged hosted webapp](https://decryptoquote.herokuapp.com/)! I just need to add some responsive design for mobile users to make it perfect, but I'm really proud of it now.

That's all I have right now. Hopefully, I won't be too overworked to check in again in a month. See you then!
