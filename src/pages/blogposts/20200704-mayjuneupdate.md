So it turns out doing 213 and 221 in the same summer term might have been a bit too much, but I did get through it okay. My 221 prof was excellent, and 213 was very interesting, at least until we got to concurrency and my brain exploded.

I had some very good news in June, when I got my co-op position! I'm going to work with the [Berlinguette Group](https://groups.chem.ubc.ca/cberling/), a research team in UBC's Department of Chemistry. They're working on discovering new materials and technologies for clean energy applications, like [electrolyzing CO2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.9b02356) to make feedstock chemicals that can be used to make a wide variety of organic compounds (drugs, plastics, etc.). They're using a [robotic experiment platform](https://groups.chem.ubc.ca/cberling/research/) called [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), which uses machine learning to find optimal combinations of materials for clean energy applications, like making a better solar cell. And I'm going to be doing Python programming as part of this robot's development! I only start in September, so I don't yet know exactly what I'll be doing, but based on my interview, it's likely to be a lot of interfacing with new sensors and actuators as they keep developing Ada for new applications.

I was focusing my applications mostly on the front end side, but I'm really excited about this position. I mean, I'll be working on a science robot with a group that's trying to make it cheap to turn air into stuff. I'm basically a tech wizard in training!

I also recently got a hammock as a good way to relax and enjoy the summer. It's good, but it's one of those things that has a [deep well of gear](https://theultimatehang.com/). I've got to be careful that I don't just buy everything!

Things have also been reopening, so I've made a point of supporting my local businesses, like my little local grocery. I had a great time just this past Friday at the [Vancouver Aquarium](https://www.vanaqua.org/), who have done a great job of laying things out so people can enjoy things and still stay safe.

This was also the month where the tragic murders (call them what they are) of [George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd) and [Breonna Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Breonna_Taylor) sparked worldwide protests against police brutality and for racial justice. I didn't attend our local protest, but I have been trying to learn what I can about Canada's own particular history of racism. To that end, I started making a regular donation to [Canadian Roots Exchange](https://canadianroots.ca/programs/national-youth-reconciliation-initiative/), which works to build relationships and understanding between Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth. I never learned much about Canadian native life or history as a kid, which is a bit of a loss for me, so I'd like to give a bit to help it happen for this generation.
