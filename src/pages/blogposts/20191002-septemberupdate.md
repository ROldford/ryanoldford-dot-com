So September is done and I'm trying to be as much like Fountain Bird (AKA Birb) as possible: calm on the surface, working hard underneath.

([This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/d6b5ll/detailed_summary_and_compilation_of_the_bird/) explains the whole Fountain Bird thing.)

I think I'm settling in to the pace of work now, and things are starting to get interesting. We've hit the famous [natural recursion](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/9u7oy0/hope_everyones_being_as_productive_as_i_am/?fbclid=IwAR3DP0ZV5H7cdus3qojw0xdCIndzbWV8ej3_0wdJKXzkZqaRsn8toZb48ME) in CPSC 110, so the problems are getting really interesting. (I still wish I could define temporary variables in my tests, though.)

CPSC 121 is proving to be the biggest issue right now. The class work and quizzes are all fine, but the homework assignments are far more difficult. I'm really feeling the strain there.

As for psychology, they're fine so far. I've found the framework for critically thinking about science reporting used in 216 to be very interesting, but that's about it. I am a bit concerned about finding the time to work on the major project for that course, but I think I can make it work.

Right now, the big worry is midterms. I've got tests for both CS courses and Psych 101 in the same week, so I've got to find some time for studying. Hopefully, by the next update, I'll have good news about them. See you then!
