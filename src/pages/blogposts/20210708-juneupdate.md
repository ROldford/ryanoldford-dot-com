If I thought May was a lot of work, June was worse!

I was really unprepared for my CPSC 304 midterm, so that put a lot of stress on me to do well in everything else, 
especially the project. Our idea was a vaccination tracking database for a health authority (of course), and we did some 
good work in the first milestones. But then we had to implement it. Which meant writing all the SQL for all the required 
queries, and also a Java Swing front end. And we really only had about 2 weeks. We just ran out of time and had so much 
that just didn't work! In the end, though, I got a mark I'm happy with, and I learned a lot, both what to do and what 
_not_ to do.

On the work side, there's not much to report. We tried to get good results with the optimizer, but the physical systems 
are really noisy, so we haven't had much luck. I'm working on getting all the documentation together using 
[Sphinx]( https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), which is a real power tool, both in good and bad ways.

With things opening up, I went to see [F9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSiDu3Ywi8E), my first movie in theaters in a 
long while. It was great! It's a deeply stupid movie series in the best ways, and it knows exactly what it is and what 
it needs to do, and I always appreciate that. I think the best part for me is Tyrese dealing with not having been killed 
yet, and starting to believe he might be immortal or something.

That's all from me. See you next time!
