April was weirdly long and short at the same time. With most of my exams being 
online and open-book, it was rather hard to get the motivation to properly 
study. But I eventually got into a good rhythm and adapted to this new way of 
life.

The CPSC 210 final project showed me one thing: your program can work really 
well on the surface, but be a bit of a trash fire underneath. One of the last 
things we had to do was a full UML diagram of our classes, and many of my data 
classes were so tied to everything else that my diagram was almost unreadable.
Also, maybe don't try to recreate the full List/AbstractList/ArrayList class 
set, complete with subviews, a week before final submission! I'll probably 
clean it up a bit and turn it into an Android app once I've learned more about 
Android app development.

I also spent some time on the 
[BattleSnake Stay Home And Code](https://tinyurl.com/ycmhxwcy) 
competition. I have the beginnings of a decision tree snake made, though it 
definitely can't do much. I also worked on a ML snake after watching 
[the workshop](https://tinyurl.com/yba969b8) by a team from AWS, but I still 
don't really understand practical ML yet. (Something to learn later!) I entered 
that snake in the competition, but didn't make it out of the first round. 
Fortunately, I wasn't the worst!

I've also been playing a lot of Animal Crossing, and it's been a good relaxing 
time. I especially love the museum! It's a beautiful and well-crafted 
environment. I really need to get a tight friend group in it though, so I can 
make use of the Best Friends features. I'm also loving how the community has 
made outside "services", especially around the Turnip market. It's getting into 
some real "Uncut Gems" territory.

(If you're playing, I made some "merch" for the UBC CSSS and BCS societies.

In terms of the pandemic, BC has been doing fairly well, all things considered. 
Daily cases haven't dropped as fast as anyone would like, but they're stable, 
so the province is apparently planning for some rollback of the lockdown. I've 
been checking [a graph](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/) I found from 
[this MinutePhysics video](https://youtu.be/54XLXg4fYsc) that does a good job
of showing where we are in the pandemic trajectory. It's been giving me a 
clearer picture, which is really helpful in an environment that easily feeds 
anxiety.

May's the start of Summer Term 1, and I'm taking CS 221 (Data Structures and 
Algorithms) and CS 213 (Computer Systems). That's a pair of really hard classes 
even in a normal term. I'll let you know how that goes next time. (Pray for me!)
