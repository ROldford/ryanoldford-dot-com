Update time! It's been 3 months, so I actually have some stuff to talk about.

Work has started well. I'm working with the Thunderbird team in the [Berlinguette Group](https://groups.chem.ubc.ca/cberling/), who are involved with [advanced nuclear fusion](https://groups.chem.ubc.ca/cberling/research/). I can't talk about the details, but my role is helping with data capture, storage and analysis. Data science isn't something I've done before, so I'm excited to see what I can do.

On the personal side, my vacation with the family was great! We rented a cabin near [Terra Nova National Park](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/nl/terranova), which was a great home base for our adventures. I got a great chance to hang out with my niece and nephew, who are just criminally adorable, and I got to drive them around on the go-kart track at [Splash n' Putt Park](http://park.splashnputt.com/). All around a great family vacation.

Back here in Vancouver, most of my personal time has been getting my apartment in order, but a recent event highlight was going to the [SHUX board game expo](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/shux22/). Some personal highlights:
- Becoming a problem gambler in [Ready, Set, Bet](https://www.alderac.com/ready-set-bet/)
- Losing my attempt to be the greatest party potato in a dance off, but getting my testimonial on the Kickstarter page for [Hot Potatoz](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/officialhotpotatoz/hot-potatoz)
- Not quite being the best dim sum eater in [SteamUp](https://hotbananagame.com/)
- Stressing over failing print journalism as a "Wind in the Willows" character in [Fit To Print](https://www.flatout.games/#/fit-to-print/)
- Sending so many robots to their death on missions in [Starship Captains](https://czechgames.com/en/starship-captains/description/)
- My near last minute winning goal in [Trick Shot](https://wolffdesigna.com/products/trickshot)
- Getting (mildly) chewed out by [Alan Gerding](https://twitter.com/alangerding?lang=en), developer of [Two Rooms And A Boom](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/tworoomsandaboom) for being history's worst room leader. (Seriously, I'd get someone's color and forget it 5 seconds later.)
- The crew "hiring" Lawyer Ethan to make up for their utter lack of legal knowledge in "Quinns' Cardboard Courtroom"
- And, of course, spending too much money.

That's basically it so far. See you all next time!

(P.S. [Splatoon 3](https://splatoon.nintendo.com/ca/) is great. [Big Man](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Big_Man) is best man. That is all.)
