Year's over, and 1 term down!

The biggest part of this month, at least in terms of school, was finals. For 
the most part, they were reasonably straightforward, with 2 exceptions. On
the CPSC 110 exam, there was a question involving a 
[trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie). That thing took me so long to
figure out! The CPSC 121 exam had a proof question involving an inequality,
which I'm not that great at. I was able to get it all the way to the last step,
but I just couldn't figure out how to do the last step.

In the end, my marks came back better than I'd expected! CPSC 110 was an A
+, 121 was an A, and both of my Psych courses were A+.

Once exams were done, I headed home to Newfoundland for Christmas. I was able
to see how my little nephew and niece are growing up, which was great, and so
was seeing the rest of the family. I also took part in the 
[Reddit Secret Santa](redditgifts.com), and that's where the card in the photo 
is from. It's a handmade watercolor card! How great is that?

Next month should be interesting, with Term 2 starting. I'm doing CPSC 210, 
so we're getting into more serious software design. I'm also doing COGS 200, 
which I've been told is a messy course, and a pair of 300's level Psych courses.
I'm looking forward to how it all goes. Wish me luck!
