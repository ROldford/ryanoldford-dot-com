Okay...

So...

I didn't forget about updating this. Last semester got really busy really fast, and I didn't have the energy or time to update, so I put it off. But that's all done now, so let's go over the last several months!

The semester ended up going well. COGS 300 was a real standout, which I wouldn't have predicted from COGS 200. Lots of interesting ideas, and I even learned more about neural networks there than in my AI course! Speaking of which, CPSC 322 (Intro to AI) was fairly dry, but professor [Jordan Johnson](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/jordon-johnson) did a great job with it. Same with CPSC 404 and professor [Ed Knorr](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/ed-knorr). (That man is a master of dead-pan dad joke delivery.) We were able to build a good project for CPSC 319, but the main thing that course taught me is why Agile exists. Finally, CPSC 444 was just a good solid extension of CPSC 344, with the benefit of doing some good project work and getting some familiarity with [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Graduation was great, but the best part was having my mother out. She was out for a week and a half, and I showed her around Vancouver to give her a feeling of my life there. She did enjoy herself, even though I really overestimated her stamina for city walking. As for graduation, not much to say really: got dressed up nice, had a nice sunny day, got my diploma and some nice photos.

With graduation, of course, comes looking for employment. I'd lined up a job in Halifax, and was all set to move out. I had ended my rental period, cancelled my Internet service, sold most of my belongings, when I got a call. Turns out the [Berlinguette Group](https://groups.chem.ubc.ca/cberling/), my old co-op employers, were starting a new team for some interesting research, and would I like to join them? Perfect timing, right? So I'll be back in Vancouver for August, and I'm really looking forward to it. It's got everything I want out of a software dev job: working with good people, solving interesting problems, and making a positive contribution to the world (and don't forget getting paid for it!)

Right now I'm at home in Newfoundland, getting some good time in with family. We've got a family trip out near [Terra Nova National Park](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/nl/terranova) coming up in about a week, so I'm really looking forward to that.

And that's basically all from here! With work starting, I think I'll move this to once every two months, just to have more to say. See you in September!
