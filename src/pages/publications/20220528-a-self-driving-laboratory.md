This publication describes the research I contributed to during my [co-op employment](/employment/20200901-berlinguettegroup), where we worked with 3M to develop systems to automate and accelerate adhesives research.

From the article abstract:

> This autonomous laboratory combines a robot for preparing and testing adhesive bonds with a Bayesian optimizer to rapidly improve adhesive formulations.
> This work demonstrates how flexible automation accelerates complex, multi-step experimental workflows for which commercial automation solutions are not available.
