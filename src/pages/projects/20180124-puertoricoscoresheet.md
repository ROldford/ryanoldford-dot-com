The classic board game Puerto Rico can be time consuming to score since it has
so many ways to get points. Having heard about React from Jordan Rhea
([rheajt](https://github.com/rheajt) on Github), I decided to try to make a
scoring webapp.

Through the use of many tutorials, I was able to understand the design
principles of React, such as components and state flow, and use them to design
the components and put them together. For visual design, I used Reactstrap, a
package based on Bootstrap, for its easy styling and layout options.

The webapp proved a success with my gaming group, and spurred me on to try other
software design projects.

**Update**: I redesigned the entire state system for the app to use Redux, 
which should make it easier to add in buildings from the expansion later.
