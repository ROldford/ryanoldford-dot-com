For CPSC 304, we were tasked with creating a database application to solve some business need. Our team chose vaccine management. The application would manage vaccine inventory and vaccination history for a large health agency.

We designed the application using Java and OracleDB, with a simple UI using Swing. We had a set of queries we had to design and implement, from simple addition and deletion, to filtered queries, to complex multi-table joins. 

We split the development of the queries evenly among the team, and were able to design the required queries, but did not fully test them. I also focused on producing the UI, and designing classes to properly link front and back end.

While we did make a major mistake by not prioritizing query testing, we did have a solid design that our whole team is proud of.
