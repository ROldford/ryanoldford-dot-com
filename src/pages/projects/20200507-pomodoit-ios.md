([Android version](/projects/20200507-pomodoit-android/))

I've found the [Pomodoro
technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to be very useful,
but every timer app I've used doesn't really fit my needs. Maybe it
automatically starts the next timer when the last is done, or it's focused on a
task list, or something like that. I finally got back into it by just focusing
on simplicity: the basic iPhone timer, and a sheet to [track what I
did](https://tinyurl.com/ybknxk4z).

Aside from learning iOS app development, I decided to make this app to enhance
my basic Pomodoro workflow. The "done" tracking will help with very long tasks
by letting me simply copy the previous entry. Entries with the same text can be
collapsed and show the number of Pomodoro cycles taken to complete, making time
estimation easier. Search will help me gain more insight into what I've been
doing and how long it's taken, and a calendar/graph will help me see trends and
keep up the habit.

At the moment, this project is at the very beginning stages, as I work through
training and tutorials to get up to speed.
