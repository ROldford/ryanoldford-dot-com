My co-op project involved working with 3M to develop a self-driving laboratory for adhesives research. 

This first involved developing software to control our robot and allow it to carry out experimental tasks. I was able to start from a developed code base, but worked to refactor the code to allow modular, configurable workflows. As well, I developed a GUI allowing users to set up, start, and monitor experimental runs.

Once this was complete, I integrated the Ax Bayesian optimizer system to make the robotic laboratory self-driving. The robot was now able to test epoxy mixtures for strength, then use the results to determine future mixtures for exploration, allowing it to determine a high-strength mixture quickly.

The results of this project are detailed in our [published journal article](/publications/20220528-a-self-driving-laboratory), as well as on my [employment post](/employment/20200901-berlinguettegroup).
